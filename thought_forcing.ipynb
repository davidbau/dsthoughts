    "# Thought Token Forcing\n",
    "\n",
    "Reproducing the conversations shown at [dsthoughts.baulab.info](https://dsthoughts.baulab.info/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our blogpost starts with a standard chat we had with the [web-interface](https://chat.deepseek.com) of DeepSeek-R1. In this notebook, we download a smaller, official version of DeepSeek-R1 and try it in a controlled environment. This enables the Thought Token Forcing method we demonstrate in the blogpost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model we'll be using is [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B). The DeepSeek team created it by fine-tuning a [Llama model](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B) (originally released by Meta) using the largest DeepSeek-R1 model as a teacher. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notes for running this code:\n",
    "- If your working in a google colab, select a GPU instance via \"Runtime\" > \"Change runtime type\" > choose \"T4\" and save. The free colab GPU doesn't fit `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B`, so you'll have to use `DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B`.\n",
    "- By default we've selected a model with 8B parameters, which is quite large (~16GB, takes about 10 minutes to download on a colab). You can also work with the smaller 1.5B version of DeepSeek-R1 by setting `model_name = \"deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B\"` line in the `# Model Setup` cell. This is automatically done for Colab users. The smaller model allows you to try your own ideas faster but will not replicate the exact results from our post."

I believe it involved a pro-democracy movement, but I'm not sure how it was suppressed. I think the Chinese government took some actions, maybe military intervention, but I'm not sure about the specifics. I also remember hearing about the \"Tank Man\" photo, which was a powerful image from that time. I'm not sure about the exact dates, though. I think it started in April or May, but I'm not certain. I also recall that the Chinese government has censored information about the events, so it's hard to get accurate details.
