# Thought Token Forcing: The DeepSeek Case

Website content here: [https://dsthoughts.baulab.info/](https://dsthoughts.baulab.info/).

You can reproduce the Thought Token Forcing method with the `thought_token_forcing.ipynb` notebook. The notebook is connected to the NDIF remote inference service, so you can run the experiment on big models without a GPU right from a [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/davidbau/dsthoughts/blob/main/thought_token_forcing.ipynb)!
